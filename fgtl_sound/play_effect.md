## FGTL_Play_Effect
This function is used to play sound effects. 
If you enter the FGTL_Sound variable with a 
different type, for example, FGTL_Sound is 
the type of music, but you play it in the 
play sound effect function, it will terminate 
your program with an error. Whatever 
the reason it will stop your program 
with an error message.
```cpp
  void FGTL_Play_Effect(FGTL_Sound* sound)
```
