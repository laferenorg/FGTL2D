# FGTL2D
**This is a library for creating 2D Games for terminal and it is only for Linux.**

This library is made just for fun and also it is made to help create games in terminal easily.

**This warning only supports Linux operating systems**, because from the start this project was only 
focused on Linux. And also if you go to other platforms it will be difficult to make because it 
will already be done but Linux is an open source platform you can use anywhere.

**See Advanced below**.
